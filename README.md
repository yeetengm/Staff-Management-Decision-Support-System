# Staff-Management-Decision-Support-System
This is a structured system (DSS) helps managers assign multiple staff members according to their capabilities.  
The system was powered by Microsoft Excel VBA.


  1. The Staff Management Decision Support System file needs to be downloaded and opened via Microsoft Excel VBA.  
This is a DDS used to help basketball managers assign their basketball players according to the player's capabilities.

  2. There are two text files for VBA Macro in this repository.  
     a. `Registration_Database`  
     b. `Manager_Main_Page`

  3. First start with the `System_Main_Page`.  
     If you wish to assign a new player, click on the `Assign Player and Qualification` button to access it.  
     If you wish to manage the players that have been assigned, click on the `manager` button to continue.

  5. You may insert the player's details and qualification in the  `Assign Player and Qualification` page.  
     Then select `assign player to team`.  
     Do not fill in the `Grade` column because it is for the backend manager to check the qualification.  
     After completion, the data will appear on the `Players Database` page.

  6. The manager may `approve` or `reject` the players in the `Manager Main Page`.  
     There are some instructions on the page, please read it carefully before proceeding.
